Since the RoboCup German Open 2022 once again did not happen due to the COVID-19 situation, an alternative was planned.

The successfull **G**erman **O**pen **R**eplacement **E**vent went into a second round for 2022, this time at the [Hamburg Handelskammer](https://www.hk24.de/en/servicemarken/event-management) from the 12.04. - 17.04.

There were 5 vs 5 SPL (Standard Platform League) physical games as well as livestreams of the [Humanoid League Virtual Season 2021/22](https://humanoid.robocup.org/hl-vs2022/humanoid-league-virtual-season-2021-22/) finals.
Due to the situation, the event even had two teams participating in a remote fashion. Meaning that the teamâ€™s software was applied to the robots at the venue, but the human members stayed at home.

We greatly want to thank everyone involved for the great time, the organizational help and a beautiful display of the pleasures of science/engineering all around!
Without all of you this event would not have been possible. Thank you!

Have a look at our [gallery](/gallery) for some impressions of the event.
