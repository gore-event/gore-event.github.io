After the successful [GORE 2022](/previous/2022/) and the great reception we were happy to announce that we organized a third round of the GORE!
The event took place **in [Hamburg at the CFEL@DESY](https://www.desy.de/research/cooperations__institutes/cfel/index_eng.html) from the 25.04. - 30.04.**

We greatly want to thank everyone involved for the great time, the organizational help and a beautiful display of the pleasures of science/engineering all around!

Without all of you this event would not have been possible. Thank you!
