Since the RoboCup German Open 2022 will once again not be happening due to the COVID-19 situation, we are once again planning an alternative.

The successfull **G**erman **O**pen **R**eplacement **E**vent from last year goes into a second round for 2022, this time here in the [Hamburg Handelskammer](https://www.hk24.de/en/servicemarken/event-management).

There will be 5 vs 5 SPL (Standard Platform League) physical games as well as livestreams of the [Humanoid League Virtual Season 2021/22](https://humanoid.robocup.org/hl-vs2022/humanoid-league-virtual-season-2021-22/) finals.
To allow for as many SPL teams as possible to participate given the current situation, the event will be held physically, but also allow teams to participate in a remote fashion.
Meaning that the teamâ€™s software will be applied to the robots at the venue, but the human members stay at home.

The whole event will, of course, be held in accordance with the current regulations advised by the RKI.
The event is planned for the time frame between the 12.04. and 17.04.
