After the successful [GORE 2022](/previous/2022/) and the great reception we are happy to announce that we are going into the third round of the GORE!
This time the event will take place **in [Hamburg at the DESY](https://www.desy.de/research/cooperations__institutes/cfel/index_eng.html) from the 25.04. - 30.04.**

There will be a 7 vs 7 SPL ([Standard Platform League](https://spl.robocup.org/)) competition, as well as participation of [Humanoid League](https://humanoid.robocup.org/) teams in the event.

To allow for as many SPL teams as possible to participate, we will also once again allow teams to participate in a remote fashion. 
Meaning that the teamâ€™s software will be applied to the robots at the venue, but the human members stay at home.
