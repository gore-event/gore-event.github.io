Since the RoboCup German Open 2022 will once again not be happening physically due to the COVID-19 situation, we are once again planning an alternative.

The successfull **G**erman **O**pen **R**eplacement **E**vent from last year goes into a second round, this time here in the [Hamburg Handelskammer](https://www.hk24.de/en/servicemarken/event-management).

We are not only planning 5 vs 5 SPL (Standard Platform League) games, but are also looking to organize humanoid league games.
Due to the unpredictability, we are preparing for different scenarios ranging from a full physical championship to a hybrid/online event.
Meaning for SPL, tha the teamâ€™s robots travel, but the human members stay at home, while doing simulated online games for the humanoid league.

The whole event will, of course, be held in accordance with the current regulations advised by the RKI.

The event is planned for the time frame between the 12.04. and 17.04.
