The event will be open to public visitors from the 15.04. to the 17.04. live at the location with a [3G model](https://www.hamburg.com/residents/settle/health/15811494/covid-access-plans), as we do not want to exclude anyone. 
We would however prefer for the people coming to test themselves.

Entry will be free, but you will have to register with our [ticketing system](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/robocup-gore-2022-registration-289399139617) to allow us to ensure a maximum number of visitors.
