At this time we are planning to allow public visitors from the 15.04. to the 17.04. live at the location with a [3G model](https://www.hamburg.com/residents/settle/health/15811494/covid-access-plans), to not exclude any visitors, but would be happy for anyone coming to test themselves.
As said the COVID-19 situation brings unpredictability, thus regulations could still change.

Entry will be free for public visitors, but there will be a ticketing system to allow us to ensure a maximum number of participants.
More concrete information as well as the link to the ticketing system will follow and be reflected on this site.
