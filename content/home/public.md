The event will be open to the public from the **27.04. - 30.04**.
Entry will be free for visitors, and we are looking forward to you joining us in this exciting look at robotics and engineering.

For anyone not able to join in person, we will also stream all games in a commented livestream on the [RoboCup SPL](https://www.youtube.com/@RoboCupSPL).

More concrete information will follow and be reflected on this site.
