At this time we are planning to allow public visitors from the 15.04. to the 17.04. live at the location with a [3G model](https://www.hamburg.com/residents/settle/health/15811494/covid-access-plans), to not exclude any visitors, but would be happy for anyone coming to test themselves.
As said the COVID-19 situation brings unpredictability, thus regulations could still change.

Entry will be free for public visitors, but visitors will have to register with our [ticketing system](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/robocup-gore-2022-registration-289399139617) to allow us to ensure a maximum number of visitors.
