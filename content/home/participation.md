Dear everyone,

as many of you have already read, there will be again **NO central** German Open this year. To provide a reasonable alternative, the SPL and Humanoid League joined together again to organize a next version of the GORE. 

The event will take place **in [Hamburg at the CFEL@DESY](https://www.desy.de/research/cooperations__institutes/cfel/index_eng.html) between the 25.04. and 30.04.23**.
The setup days will be on the 25th and 26th and the competition days from the 27th to the 30th of April.
To get a better feeling about the size of the event, we would like to ask if you and your team would like to participate?

_For the SPL:_
- URG/Aldebaran has been contacted, but we are still waiting for an official confirmation that they will be on site.
- Remote participation should also be possible, as it was last year. For this we need your help:
    - **Presence** teams: It would be good if you could also tell us if you would be willing to provide the remote teams with robots as part of a common robot pool. 
    - **Remote** teams: It is not yet clear whether we can realize your participation in the competition. We try to give our best, but it can also be that it ends up with only a few friendly games. 

We expect the participation to cost about **200€ per team plus 75€ per team member**, we will let you know the exact numbers as soon as we have them, and it is likely to become less again.
If you are interested in participating in the GORE 2023, send a reply to gore.organisation@gmail.com containing:

- Your team's name
- Your teams league (SPL or Humanoid)
- An approximate count of how many people you will bring?
- _SPL:_ Whether you want to participate in presence or remote?
- _SPL:_ Are you willing to provide robots for a robot pool?

Please send your **replies by February 27th**, so that we can plan better.
You will receive further information via upcoming newsletter.

See you soon. The GORE 2023 organizing committee.

Arne, Jasper, Jörn and Patrick
