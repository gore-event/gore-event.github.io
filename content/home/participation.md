Dear everyone,

as many of you have already read, there will again be no German Open this year. To provide a reasonable alternative, the SPL and Humanoid League joined together to organize the German Open Replacement Event (GORE). The event will take place between the 12.04. and 17.04.22. To get a better feeling about the size of the event, we would like to ask you, if and in what way you and your team would like to participate.

At the current time we are still planning to hold the event in presence, if the COVID-19 situation still allows it by then. If that is the case, the event will take place in Hamburg, Germany in the Handelskammer. We are following the regulations advised by the RKI, which means only persons who recovered from COVID or fully vaccinated persons are admitted if they can also present a negative test result. People with a booster vaccination do not need a test. In any case, participants are required to wear a medical mask at all times.

Since the situation is changing quickly and unpredictably, we are also preparing online (for HL: simulated; for SPL: running your code on a common robot pool from home) or hybrid (for SPL: teams that cannot be on site can either send robots or use shared robots from other teams similar to a robot pool) solutions, please let us know, which of these alternatives works best for you.

For the SPL, Softbank Robotics has also already announced that they will be on site to facilitate repairs.

We expect the participation to cost about 200€ per team plus 75€ per team member, we will let you know the exact numbers as soon as we have them and it is likely to become less again. If you are interested in participating in the GORE, please send a reply to gore.organisation@gmail.com containing:

Your team name
Your teams league (SPL or Humanoid)
Whether you want to participate in presence, online or hybrid
An approximate count of how many people you will bring
Please send your replies by February 20th, so that we can plan better.

See you soon and stay healthy.

The GORE organizing committee Arne, Jörn, Patrick and Sebastian
