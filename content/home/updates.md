Dear GORE 2023 teams,

this is the newest information regarding the **GORE 2023** from the **25.04. - 30.04.23** in Hamburg, Germany.

**Please fill out this [registration form](https://forms.gle/dw4MkqahRyPkEbPv5) until 09.04.2023 to officially register**.


Currently, 9-10 SPL teams have expressed their interest to participate on site. 
Additionally, there is one remote team which would like to participate. 
Unfortunately, the availability of shared robots among the teams is significantly lower this year for various reasons.
Therefore, we offered them one or two test games, but could otherwise not guarantee a full participation.

Also, there are two teams joining from the humanoid league, and they will be playing against each other so that this will also offer exciting games.
In addition, we are again broadcasting the semi-finals and finals of the Humanoid Virtual League on the final Sunday (on a screen), including commentators.

## Venue and delivery of robots

For teams that would prefer not to carry their robots but would like to ship them, please send them to the following address:

> TUHH / HULKs e.V. \
> Denickestr. 17  \
> 21073 Hamburg, Germany

For all other teams there will be another mail shortly before the event regarding the possibility to deliver the robots respectively where to unload the robots at the [CFEL@DESY](https://www.desy.de/research/cooperations__institutes/cfel/index_eng.html).

A rough overview plan regarding the spatial layout in the [CFEL@DESY](https://www.desy.de/research/cooperations__institutes/cfel/index_eng.html) is available [here](CFEL_lageplan_small.pdf).

**TEAM & PARTICIPANT (ON-SITE) REGISTRATION**: _Until April 09, 2023_

The invoice regarding the final participation fees will be sent after the event, as the exact amount may still be reduced due to sponsors.

## United Robotics Group / [Aldebaran](https://www.aldebaran.com/en)

As already announced, United Robotics Group, will be on site for the repair of the NAOs.

However, for this, the robot body/head IDs are required from each team.
Please include these in the [registration form](https://forms.gle/dw4MkqahRyPkEbPv5) (it can include all your robots or if you already know which ones you will bring then only the ones that will be carried).

## Consent/Release Form

Since we are an official RoboCup event there is again the familiar consent/release form, as usual.
This can be found as an attachment to this mail so that you can already read and have a look at it.

On the first day before you are let in you have to sign this document on site, otherwise participation is not possible! If you want to make it easier for us, then bring this document already signed, but we also have a few forms printed out on site.

## Game Mode

We have decided to play again first with the [Swiss system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss-system_tournament) a first ranking, with a total of 5-6 rounds, and then the top 8 teams play out the final winners in a KO tournament with the help of quarterfinals, semifinals and finals.

## Schedule

A first preliminary schedule can be seen [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vS53qa2npdSX8EW1PAyNJDyesn6wSk1LtYwjwkcPbzGbSQF7ULB8XxJcGOXE8JzAkajY78gUeOkiaSb/pubhtml?gid=1051099068).

In general, there are always 2 games running parallel on the two fields, each on field B is shifted by 10 minutes to allow the spectators and the streaming to continuously watch about 40 minutes of game play.
It is clear to us that delays and timeouts can shift the whole schedule, but generally we want to keep the 10' minute offset from the beginning of the first game in each time slot.

Since we have a lot to build up and tear down for this event we would like to ask the teams to help us with both the build up and the tear down.
As common times for the construction we have planned the 25.04. from 12 clock (also earlier) and for the dismantling after the final game on Sunday 30.04 approximately at 14:15. 
We appreciate your support. 
Together we can manage this in short time.

The opening hours of the [CFEL@DESY](https://www.desy.de/research/cooperations__institutes/cfel/index_eng.html) for us are from 7:30 until around 21:30-22:00.

## Communication and Meeting

If a team wants to join GORE 2023 remotely (e.g. for test games), we will conduct meetings in a hybrid manner using Discord.
Also, for miscellaneous communication, there will be a special section on the vRoHOW server.
This area will also be used for possible remote team to on site assistant communication.
Please bring your wireless headset with mic (otherwise wireless hardware is not allowed).

It would be kind of you, if you could post/promote on your social media accounts about GORE 2023 to make this event more public.
For the audience there is the possibility from the 27.04 until the 30.04. to come and watch the games live.

To prepare refereeing during GORE 2023 please prepare yourself by studying the official 2023 rules: [SPL Soccer Rules 2023](https://spl.robocup.org/downloads/)

In general, please note that we will already play with the new RobobCup 2023 rules.
However, some minor things might be changed, but this will be discussed in the first team leader meeting.

## Food & Drinks

During GORE 2023 you can again buy drinks like coke, water, lemonade, mate or beer for budget/net price (cash or PayPal).

Food can be bought in shops outside the venue. We are currently evaluating the possibility of getting a food truck.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us.
Otherwise, we see us on 25.04. starting at 12 o'clock in the [CFEL@DESY](https://www.desy.de/research/cooperations__institutes/cfel/index_eng.html) in Hamburg and look forward to a nice and safe event with you.

The GORE 2023 organizing committee.

Arne, Jasper, Jörn, Jonathan and Patrick
